## Future Enhancements

- Fully responsive layout across all devices.
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) implementation for better performance and SEO.
- Redesign genre and status filtering to decouple logic and improve maintainability.
- Implement complex state management using a robust library like Redux or Zustand.
- Fetch book data via API or store in a database (Goodreads no longer supports their API).
- Ensure semantic correctness by using links instead of buttons for navigation.
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all components to improve reliability.
- Improve AI analysis accuracy by integrating a more advanced model.
- Analytics insights to track user interactions, such as most viewed books or genres.
- AI-powered recommendations for new books based on current books.
- Screen reader testing with NVDA to ensure accessibility for visually impaired users.
- Adopt a feature-based folder structure for better scalability and maintainability.
- Use a robust state management library like Redux Toolkit or Zustand for predictable state handling.
- Achieve at least 80% test coverage and add end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress or Playwright.
- Enable strict mode in TypeScript and define reusable types/interfaces for API responses and component props.
- Use design tokens for consistent theming and consider CSS-in-JS libraries for dynamic styling needs.
- Perform manual accessibility testing with screen readers and add keyboard navigation tests.
- Optimize performance with React.memo, useCallback, code-splitting, and lazy loading.
- Implement a service layer for API calls and use caching libraries like React Query or SWR.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or CircleCI for automated testing and deployment.
- Add API documentation, a contribution guide, and a changelog for better collaboration.
- Implement a global error boundary and log errors to a service like Sentry.
- Sanitize user inputs, use HTTPS, and audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- Integrate analytics tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel to track user interactions.
- Plan for horizontal scaling with Docker and serverless functions.
